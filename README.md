# ML summer projects
Repository for summer work at Imperial under supervision of Daneil Platt and Daattavya Argarwal.

# Prep-work/ Project 1
prepworkSasakian.py and deep_sets.py involve implementing NN to learn Sasakian Hodge numbers and CN invariant [(1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269324000753?via%3Dihub), deep sets [(2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114) are then introduced to ensure permutation invariance.

The topological invariants are in file: Topological_Data.txt giving the weights for the Sasakian Hodge numbers and CN invariant.

Install packages in requirements.txt. Tested with Python 3.9.6.
